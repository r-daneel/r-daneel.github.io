How Windows tricks you into running their browser
-------------------------------------------------

When on the lock screen, there are links.
For instance, one leads you to bing on the image that is showing on the lock screen's background.
Neat feature, isn't it ?
Well, when you click, you're prompted to login.
Once done, the Edge browser is invoked, even though the default system browser is Firefox.

Just ... Amazing.
